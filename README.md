# StashPic
I love to play Rust. And I like to hide things underground. Sometimes this was the only thing that saved me during the raid. I also like to search for bases for a raid, but uploading screenshots to friends on social networks is not very convenient. I'm also a web developer. This is how the stashmap.net and StashPic appeared, as the sender of screenshots.

## General info
StashPic allows you to take screenshots during the game using hotkeys and automatically sends them to the stashmap.net site, where they are used to create markers on the map. The marker stores images of the location of small stash on the ground, images of the location on the map and images of the contents of small stash. Thus, you will never forget where you buried the small stash and what it contains. You can also make markers with images of enemy bases in order to decide with the clan which base is better to raid.

## Technologies
* Indy Clients IdHTTP - to send screenshots and communicate with the server
* Registry - to store application config data
* Threads - to upload images quickly 
* Global hotkeys - to take and send screenshots directly from the game

## Setup
For the application to work, you only need a StashPic.exe file and the media directory

## Features
* Sending screenshots to the server
* Launch Rust when the application starts
* Launch Rust and connect to specified server when the application starts
* Close application when Rust close

## Status
Project is: _finished_
